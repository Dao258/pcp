## Install


## Usage

The receiving peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp receive
Your identity:

	16Uiu2HAkwyP8guhAXN66rkn8BEw3SjBavUuEu4VizTHhRcu7WLxq

Waiting for peers to connect... (cancel with strg+c)
```

The sending peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp send my_file
Querying peers that are waiting to receive files...

Found the following peer(s):
[0] 16Uiu2HAkwyP8guhAXN66rkn8BEw3SjBavUuEu4VizTHhRcu7WLxq

Select the peer you want to send the file to [#,r,q,?]:
```

At this point the sender needs to select the receiving peer, who in turn needs to confirm the file transfer.

## Development

### Generate Protobuf definitions

First install the protoc compiler:

```shell
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
```

Then run from the root of this repository:

```shell
protoc -I=pkg/pb --go_out=pkg/pb --go_opt=paths=source_relative p2p.proto
```

The proto defintions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.
