## Motivation

There already exists a long list of file transfer tools (see [Related Efforts](#related-efforts)), so why bother
building another one? The problem I had with the existing tools is that they rely on
a [limited set of](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) [servers](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#relays)
to orchestrate peer matching and data relaying which poses a centralisation concern. Many of the usual centralisation
vs. decentralisation arguments apply here, e.g. the servers are single points of failures, the service operator has the
power over whom to serve and whom not, etc. Further, as
this [recent issue in croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) shows, this is a real risk for sustainable
operation of the provided service. A benevolent big player jumped in to sponsor the service.

[comment]: <> (The `identify` discovery mechanism serves the same role as `STUN`, but without the need for a set of `STUN` servers. The libp2p `Circuit Relay` protocol allows peers to communicate indirectly via a helpful intermediary peer that is found via the DHT. This replaces dedicated `TURN` servers.)

## Project Status

The tool is in a very early stage, and I'm aware of performance, usability and **security** issues. Don't use it for anything serious.
Although I criticised tools like [`magic-wormhole`](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) or [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc) above, they are amazing and way more mature.

There are also drawbacks with this approach: It's slower than established centralised methods if
you want to transmit data across network boundaries. A DHT query to find your peer can easily take several minutes.
Further, the bandwidth and geographic location of a potential relaying peer is not guaranteed which can lead to long transmission times.

## How does it work?

When running `pcp send` a new [peer identity](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/) is generated.
The first bytes of the public key are encoded in four words from the Bitcoin improvement proposal [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md), so each word is basically random among the 2048 possible words. The first word is interpreted as a channel ID in the range from 0 to 2047.
`pcp` advertises in its local network via mDNS and in the DHT of IPFS the identifier `/pcp/{unix-timestamp}/channel-id`.
The unix timestamp is the current time truncated to 5 minutes and the prefix `/pcp` is the protocol prefix.

Your peer enters `pcp receive four-words-from-above` and `pcp` uses the first word together with the current time truncated to 5 minutes to find the sending peer in the DHT and in your local network via mDNS.
When the peer is found, its public key is checked against the three remaining words (as the words were derived from that key), and a password authenticated key exchange happens to authenticate each other.
The key exchange is **not** used for encryption as the connection uses TLS per default. After the peer is authenticated the receiver must confirm the file transfer, and the file gets transmitted. 

## Usage

The sending peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp send my_file
Code is:  bubble-enemy-result-increase
On the other machine run:
	pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase
```

The receiving peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase
Looking for peer bubble-enemy-result-increase...
```

If you're on different networks the lookup can take quite long (~ 2-3 minutes). Currently, there is no output while both parties are working on peer discovery, so just be very patient.

## Install

### Release download

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/releases) and download the latest binary for
your platform.

### From source

To compile it yourself clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp.git
```

Navigate into the `pcp` folder and run:

```shell
go install cmd/pcp/pcp.go # Go 1.13 or higher is required
```

Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` variable to access the installed `pcp` executable.

### Package managers

It's on the roadmap to distribute `pcp` via `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, `scoop` and more ...

## Development

### Protobuf definitions

First install the protoc compiler:

```shell
make tools # downloads gofumpt and protoc
make proto # generates protobuf
```

The current proto definitions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.

## Feature Roadmap

Shamelessly copied from `croc`:

- [x] allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
  - ‚úÖ using mDNS and DHT for peer discovery and [AutoRelay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/#autorelay) / [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)
- [x] provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
  - ‚úÖ actually PAKE is only used for authentication TLS for end-to-end encryption
- [x] enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
  - ü§î‚úÖ only tested Linux <-> Mac
- [ ] allows multiple file transfers
  - ‚ùå not yet
- [ ] allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
  - ‚ùå not yet
- [x] local server or port-forwarding not needed
  - ‚úÖ thanks to [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)
- [ ] ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback
  - ü§î I think that's the case, but I'm not sure about the libp2p internals
- [ ] can use proxy, like tor
  - ‚ùå not yet
